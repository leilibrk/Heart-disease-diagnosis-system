Fuzzy expert system for heart disease diagnosis
Developed a fuzzy expert system consisting of three major steps, i.e. fuzzification, rule base and defuzzification for heart disease diagnosis implemented in Python.
The proposed fuzzy expert system consists of three major steps i.e. fuzzification, rule base and defuzzification. The system has 13 input fields (such as blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and etc.) and one output field which shows the presence of heart disease in the patient.
